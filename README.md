*Review*

This is one of my favorite teen love story film from Kathniel. This show is the best cause it represents the real value of love and it's worth sacrificing by making difficult decisions that would cause a painful and pure devastation for the teen couple. They are willing to let go and to endure the pain cause that's how they make sacrifices to be able to show much they genuinely loved each other. It's a very emotional movie and at the same time so worth the time to invest.

*Lessons that I've Learned from the movie*

1. It tells us the story of how love can help change a person to become better.
2. It shows how forgiveness is so important.
3. Life is full of challenges, but it doesn't mean that you should give up.
